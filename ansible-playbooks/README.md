# Ansible Playbooks

Ah, I see you found my collection of Ansible Playbooks!

For those that are not familiar with Ansible yet, Ansible Playbooks provide a way to set up local or remote computer systems according to pre-written tasks. For example, installing and configuring software on one or multiple servers or setting up desktop systems in a corporate environment. It's very flexible and extensible.



## List of Ansible Playbooks

I currently only have one playbook, for setting up new Ubuntu-based Desktop systems.

- [ubuntu-desktop-setup](./ubuntu-desktop-setup) &mdash;Â Set up new Ubuntu Desktop systems.

I will add more playbooks in the future.
