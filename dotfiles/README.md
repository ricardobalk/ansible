# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

## Installation

The most easy and recommend way of installing these dotfiles is as follows:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xutils-dev
lndir '/path/to/this/repository/dotfiles/' "$HOME"
```

This will populate your home directory with symlinks to the dotfiles in this directory.

P.S. Don't forget to set your own preferences before doing so. :wink:
