# dotfiles &#x2795;

This repository contains my dotfiles and also some awesome Ansible playbooks, that can be used for setting up new systems from scratch the way I like it.

In non-geek language &mdash; I have an empty computer, I want to install some apps that I use regularly, so those need to be installed. But I like to get shit done, and am automating as many things as possible. In other words...

## Repository Contents

Right now, it includes 

- [an Ansible playbook for setting up new desktop systems.](./ansible-playbooks) It has been designed for and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.

- [dotfiles](./dotfiles), which are basic configuration files common on \*nix, macOS. I believe you could use them with WSL2, too. Not sure. :sweat_smile:
