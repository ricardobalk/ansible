Ah, I see you found my collection of Ansible Playbooks, Roles and Tasks!

For those that are not familiar with Ansible yet, Ansible provides a way to set up local or remote computer systems according to pre-written playbooks, roles and tasks. It's very flexible and extensible.

## Ansible Playbooks

I currently only have one playbook, for setting up new Ubuntu-based Desktop systems.

- [ubuntu-desktop-setup](./ubuntu-desktop-setup) &mdash;Â Set up new Ubuntu Desktop systems.

I will add more playbooks in the future.
